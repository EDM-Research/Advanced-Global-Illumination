# Advanced Global Illumination
## Second Edition

These slide sets contain the images from the book [Advanced Global Illumination](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/handle/1942/1720). We hope that lecturers in global illumination as well as others will find them useful.

Art-work not by the authors is marked as such. Non-marked art-work is by Ph. Dutre (chapter 4, 5, 7-bidirectional path tracing, appendix B), Ph. Bekaert (chapter 6, 8, appendix A) and K. Bala (chapter 2, 3, 7-photon mapping).
